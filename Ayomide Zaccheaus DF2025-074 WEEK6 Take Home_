Weather Data Analysis (2014)\n","\n","## 1. Overview\n","This analysis examines 2014 weather data for six major world cities — Beijing, Brasilia, Cape Town, Delhi, London, and Moscow — using Python’s pandas and numpy libraries.  \n","The study compares temperature, precipitation, humidity, wind speed, and weather events to understand global climatic differences.  \n","Results show clear distinctions between tropical, temperate, and continental climates: Brasilia was the warmest and wettest city, while Moscow was the coldest and most variable.  \n","Overall, the findings highlight how geography and latitude influence temperature stability, rainfall intensity, and humidity across regions.\n","\n","---\n","\n","## 2. Temperature Insights\n","- Brasilia recorded the highest average temperature at 22.9°C, followed by Cape Town at 17.6°C.  \n","- Moscow was the coldest city with an annual average of 5.99°C.  \n","- Beijing and Delhi showed similar mean temperatures (around 13°C) but both experienced large temperature ranges of 55°C, indicating strong seasonal variation.  \n","- The hottest day of the year occurred in Beijing (42°C on May 29), while the coldest was in Moscow (-26°C on January 30).\n","\n","Interpretation:  \n","These results reflect diverse climate zones. Brasilia’s consistently high temperatures represent a tropical climate, while Moscow’s cold averages and wide range are characteristic of a continental climate with severe winters.\n","\n","---\n","\n","## 3. Precipitation Patterns\n","- Brasilia was the wettest city with a total precipitation of 751.65 mm, followed by London with 503.10 mm.  \n","- Moscow recorded 0 mm of precipitation, possibly due to snow not being measured as rainfall in this dataset.  \n","- Beijing experienced the single heaviest rainfall (75.95 mm on September 1).  \n","- Delhi received the least total rainfall at 225.31 mm, typical of its semi-arid conditions.\n","\n","Interpretation:  \n","Tropical regions such as Brasilia have extended wet seasons, while temperate and inland cities experience more moderate or infrequent rainfall. London’s rainfall was steady throughout the year, aligning with its maritime climate.\n","\n","---\n","\n","## 4. Wind Speed and Humidity Comparison\n","- Cape Town was the windiest city with an average wind speed of 16.93 km/h, followed by London (13.86 km/h) and Moscow (12.84 km/h).  \n","- Delhi had the lowest average wind speed at 5.92 km/h.  \n","- London and Moscow were the most humid cities (approximately 74%), while Beijing and Delhi were the driest (around 50%).\n","\n","Interpretation:  \n","Coastal cities such as Cape Town and London maintain high humidity and frequent winds due to maritime influences. Inland cities like Delhi and Beijing remain drier with lower air movement.\n","\n","---\n","\n","## 5. Temperature Range and Variability\n","- Moscow showed the widest temperature range (59°C), while Brasilia had the most stable climate with only a 27°C difference between its maximum and minimum temperatures.\n","\n","Interpretation:  \n","Cities closer to the equator, such as Brasilia, maintain steady temperatures throughout the year, whereas high-latitude cities like Moscow experience extreme seasonal changes.\n","\n","---\n","\n","## 6. Correlation Insights\n","The correlation analysis revealed the following relationships across all cities:\n","- Temperature and humidity: -0.30 (negative correlation) – warmer days tend to be less humid.  \n","- Temperature and visibility: +0.27 – hotter days generally have clearer visibility.  \n","- Humidity and visibility: -0.28 – higher humidity reduces visibility due to mist or fog.  \n","- Wind speed and visibility: +0.28 – windy conditions tend to improve air clarity.\n","\n","Interpretation:  \n","These mild correlations indicate how atmospheric factors interact. Higher humidity often reduces visibility, while higher temperatures coincide with clearer skies and lower moisture levels.\n","\n","---\n","\n","## 7. Weather Event Frequency\n","- Beijing and Delhi had many clear-weather days (no major weather events), typical of inland continental regions.  \n","- London had the highest number of recorded rain events (202 days), confirming its reputation for frequent rainfall.  \n","- Moscow recorded numerous snow events (73), reflecting its long and cold winters.  \n","- Brasilia had frequent thunderstorm occurrences (75 events), consistent with tropical weather patterns.\n","\n","---\n","\n","## 8. Summary of City Climate Characteristics\n","| City | Climate Summary |\n","|------|------------------|\n","| Beijing | Moderate average temperature with dry winters and occasional heavy rain. |\n","| Brasilia | Warm, humid, and tropical with high rainfall and many thunderstorms. |\n","| Cape Town | Mild temperatures, windy conditions, and moderate rainfall influenced by the ocean. |\n","| Delhi | Hot summers and cool winters with low rainfall and humidity. |\n","| London | Cool, humid, and consistently rainy, typical of a maritime climate. |\n","| Moscow | Very cold continental climate with large seasonal temperature variations. |\n","\n","---\n","\n","## 9. Overall Conclusion\n","- Brasilia is the warmest and wettest city overall.  \n","- Moscow is the coldest and most seasonally variable.  \n","- Cape Town experiences the strongest winds, while London remains the most humid and consistently cool.  \n","- Delhi and Beijing show strong continental influences with large temperature differences and relatively low humidity.  \n","- Across all cities, higher temperatures are associated with lower humidity and better visibility, indicating inverse relationships between heat and moisture levels.\n","\n","---\n"],"metadata":{"id":"bRY3BIBDv4Xf"},"id":"bRY3BIBDv4Xf"},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"6f1a4eb9","metadata":{"id":"6f1a4eb9"},"source":["# Link to your publication"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["https://papizee.hashnode.dev/exploring-global-weather-patterns-with-pandas-and-numpy"],"metadata":{"id":"WJn7hqH175-G"},"id":"WJn7hqH175-G"}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3 (ipykernel)","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.12.7"},"colab":{"provenance":[]}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":5}
